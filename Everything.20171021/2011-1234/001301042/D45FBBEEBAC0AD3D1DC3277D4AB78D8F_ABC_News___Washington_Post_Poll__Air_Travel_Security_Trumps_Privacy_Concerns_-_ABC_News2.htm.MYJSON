Overall results in this ABC News/Washington Post poll mark the public\u0027s longstanding emphasis on security over privacy. Sixty-four percent support the use of the scanning machines, even though they produce x-ray images of a passenger\u0027s unclothed body that security officials can see. Half as many are opposed, and \"strong\" supporters outnumber strong opponents, also by 2-to-1.","fb_title":"Poll: Americans Mixed on Pat-Downs","keywords":"poll, transportation security administration, TSA, scanner, flying, air travel, pat-downs, terrorism, travel, profiling, security, abc news washington post poll, politics, washington, dc politics, obama, president barack obama, abc news politics, abc politics, this week, white house, first lady, first lady michelle obama, congress, economy, jobs, health care reform, iraq, afghanistan, national security, democrat, republican, tea parties, hillary clinton, sarah palin, john mccain, john edwards, elizabeth edwards, election 2012, midterm elections, dick cheney, nancy pelosi, harry reid, joe biden, supreme court, george stephanopoulos, jake tapper, martha raddatz, abc news online, abcnews.com, online news","og:image":"http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/nm_tsa_101122_me.jpg","resourceName":"D45FBBEEBAC0AD3D1DC3277D4AB78D8F_ABC_News___Washington_Post_Poll__Air_Travel_Security_Trumps_Privacy_Concerns_-_ABC_News2.htm","robots":["noarchive","index, follow"],"title":"ABC News / Washington Post Poll: Air Travel Security Trumps Privacy Concerns - ABC News"}
