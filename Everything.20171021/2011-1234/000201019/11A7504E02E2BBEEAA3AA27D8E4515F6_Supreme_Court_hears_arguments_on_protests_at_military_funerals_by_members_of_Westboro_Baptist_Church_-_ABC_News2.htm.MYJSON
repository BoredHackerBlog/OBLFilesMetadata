The case concerns the Westboro Baptist Church and its Pastor, Fred W. Phelps, whose congregation travels the country and protests at the funerals of fallen servicemen. The congregation is made up mostly of Phelps\u0027 family members who believe that soldiers are dying, in part because there are gays serving in the military. The church members get permits for their protests near funerals and carry signs saying things like , \"God Hates You\" and \"God hates fags.\" ","fb_title":"Controversial Case Hits Supreme Court","keywords":"supreme court, military, protests, military funerals, Westboro Baptist Church, Pastor, Fred W.
