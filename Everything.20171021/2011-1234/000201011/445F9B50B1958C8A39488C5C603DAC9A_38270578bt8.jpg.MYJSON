Ethiopian and Somali government forces are advancing towards Somalia\u0027s capital Mogadishu, which is currently held by UIC after they seized the strategic town of Jowhar, 90 km from the capital, from the Islamists during a dawn attack. At the weekend Ethiopia began a major offensive against the UIC, which held much of central and southern Somalia. Jowhar is a former UIC stronghold, and its loss leaves the Islamists with control of little more than the coast. The Ethiopian and pro-government Somali troops are reported to be only 30 km from Mogadishu.   --- Image by © ABUKAR ALBADRI /epa/Corbis","City":"MOGADISHU","Class":"Display Device","Color space":"RGB","Comments":"AppleMark\n","Component 1":"Y component: Quantization table 0, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 2":"Cb component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 3":"Cr component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Compression Type":"Baseline","Content-Length":"171917","Content-Type":"image/jpeg","Copyright":"(c) 1999 Adobe Systems Inc.","Copyright Flag":"Yes","Copyright Notice":"© Corbis.
