{"Comment":"Islamic courts militia patrol the enclosure of the presidential palace in southern Mogadishu, in this 27, July 2006 photo after it was handed over by former warlords occupying the bullet scarred office compound known as \u0027Villa Somalia\u0027. A resident to Presidents from 1960 to 1991, when it was taken over by Mohammed Farah Aideed after dictator Mohammed Siad Barre was ousted, the take over, of the last warlord stronghold, is viewed as of great significance by the increasingly powerful Islamists, who have so far seized control of the main seaport and airport in Mogadishu along with much southern Somalia.
