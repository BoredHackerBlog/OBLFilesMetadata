Catholics and Protestants are more or less divided in their views, while Mormons are the most likely to favor the war. Those with no religious affiliation also oppose the war, but not to the same extent that Jewish people do.","DISTRIBUTION":"Global","KEYWORDS":"","PRAGMA":"no-cache","REVISIT-AFTER":"30 days","ROBOTS":"INDEX, FOLLOW, NOARCHIVE","X-Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.html.HtmlParser"],"dc:title":"Among Religious Groups, Jewish Americans Most Strongly Oppose War","resourceName":"1596AEFD7BFFDF07DAFF25FCE48B8A5E_Among_Religious_Groups,_Jewish_Americans_Most_Strongly_Oppose_War.htm","title":"Among Religious Groups, Jewish Americans Most Strongly Oppose War"}
