{"Color Transform":"YCbCr","Comment":"RAMSTEIN AIR FORCE BASE, GERMANY - UNDATED:  A casket bearing the remains of U.S. Navy Seal Chief Hospital Corpsman Matthew J. Bourgeois is strapped to the floor onboard a C-17A Globemaster III aircraft at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base, Uzbekistan for the flight to Ramstein Air Base in Germany in this photo released April 28, 2005 by the Pentagon. The release this week of more than 700 images showing the return of American casualties to U.S. military facilities follows Freedom of Information Act requests and a lawsuit charging the Pentagon with failing to comply with the act. Bourgeois was killed by a land mine during operations near Kandahar, Afghanistan.
