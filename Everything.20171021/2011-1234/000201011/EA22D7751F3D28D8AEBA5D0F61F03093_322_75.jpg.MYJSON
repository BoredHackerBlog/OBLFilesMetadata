{"Caption/Abstract":"Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh (C-white shirt) is flanked by his body guards after returning to the podium to resume his speech to Hamas supporters during a rally in Gaza City, 06 October 2006. Haniya appeared briefly unwell at the mass rally in support of his embattled Hamas-led government, and was helped away from the podium by aides. The Prime Minister, who is observing the Muslim fast of Ramadan, under which the faithful can neither eat nor drink from sunrise to sunset, got back up within minutes and resumed his speech.
