{"Color Transform":"YCbCr","Comment":"NEW YORK - JANUARY 05:  A couple walks past a cherry blossom tree that has bloomed at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden on an unusually mild day January 5, 2007 in New York City. Cherry blossoms usually bloom at the beginning of spring. New York and the rest of the east coast have thus far experienced an abnormally mild winter. Partly blaming global warming, British climate scientists predict that 2007 could be the world\u0027s hottest year on record. The current warmest year on record is 1998, when the average global temperature was 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the long-term average of 57 F.
