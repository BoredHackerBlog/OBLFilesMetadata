Tens of thousands of protesters marched against the Iraq war, taking their message on placards, \"US out of Iraq now,\" to the Pentagon\u0027s doorstep ahead of the fourth anniversary of the US invasion. Demonstrators from across the United States gathered in a cold winter day to descend on the US Defense Department offices and decry the conflict that has killed more than 3,200 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians.
