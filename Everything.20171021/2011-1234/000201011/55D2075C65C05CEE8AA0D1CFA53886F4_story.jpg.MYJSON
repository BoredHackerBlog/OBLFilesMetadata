Osama bin Laden\u0027s right-hand man slammed Hamas, without naming it, for recognizing Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and taking part in elections on the basis of a secular constitution. The turbaned Egyptian-born Zawahiri frequently speaks for Al-Qaeda in video or audiotapes, some posted on internet sites, like As-Sahab, and others aired by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.
