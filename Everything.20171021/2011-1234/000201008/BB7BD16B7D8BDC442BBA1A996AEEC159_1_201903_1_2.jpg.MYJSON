{"Color Transform":"YCbCr","Comment":"Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem (L) speaks to his Iraqi counterpart Hoshyar Zebari (R) during a meeting at the international airport in Baghdad, 19 November 2006. Muallem today called for a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq, as the authorities announced that the suicide car bomber who killed 22 workers was a Syrian. Muallem, the first Syrian minister to visit Iraq since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, is expected to hold talks with Iraqi leaders about repeated US and Iraqi complaints that Damascus has done too little to stop the flow of insurgents and weapons across its border.\rAFP PHOTO/POOL/ALI JASSEM","Component 1":"Y component: Quantization table 0, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 2":"Cb component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 3":"Cr component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Compression Type":"Baseline","Content-Length":"26358","Content-Type":"image/jpeg","DCT Encode Version":"25600","Data Precision":"8 bits","File Modified Date":"Fri Nov 10 23:31:00 -05:00 2017","File Name":"BB7BD16B7D8BDC442BBA1A996AEEC159_1_201903_1_2.jpg","File Size":"26358 bytes","Flags 0":"192","Flags 1":"0","Image Height":"242 pixels","Image Width":"363 pixels","Number of Components":"3","Quality":"60","Resolution Units":"none","Thumbnail Height Pixels":"0","Thumbnail Width Pixels":"0","X Resolution":"100 dots","X-Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.jpeg.JpegParser"],"Y Resolution":"100 dots","resourceName":"BB7BD16B7D8BDC442BBA1A996AEEC159_1_201903_1_2.jpg","tiff:BitsPerSample":"8","tiff:ImageLength":"242","tiff:ImageWidth":"363"}
