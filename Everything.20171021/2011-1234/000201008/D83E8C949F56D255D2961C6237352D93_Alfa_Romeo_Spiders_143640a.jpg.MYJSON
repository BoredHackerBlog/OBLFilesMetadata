{"Color Transform":"YCbCr","Comment":"Caption\u003d13963 SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA February 17, 2007 . The 2007 Alfa Spider is a legend among open-top sports cars.The heir to the Giulietta Spider and the unforgettable Duetto - genuine motoring icons - the model, launched at the Geneva Motor Show, immediately won the title of ÔCabrio of the Year 2006Õ. The Alfa Spider is the most stunning and evolved example of the new generation of Alfa Romeo cars. An all-Italian car, the result of a collaboration between the Alfa Romeo Style Centre and two of the biggest names in Italian styling: Giugiaro and Pininfarina. The essential, simple style - as you would expect of a Ôtwo-seaterÕ - conveys both elegance and strength: the Alfa spider is not just beautiful, it is also the maximum expression of technology and sportiness. The welcoming passenger cabin and quality of the advanced equipment mark the return of a legend.Photograph: Paul Harris © pacificcoastnews.com***FEE MUST BE AGREED PRIOR TO USAGE*** UK OFFICE: +44 131 225 3333/3322 US OFFICE: 1 310 261 9676","Component 1":"Y component: Quantization table 0, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 2":"Cb component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 3":"Cr component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Compression Type":"Baseline","Content-Length":"7566","Content-Type":"image/jpeg","DCT Encode Version":"25600","Data Precision":"8 bits","File Modified Date":"Fri Nov 10 23:33:51 -05:00 2017","File Name":"D83E8C949F56D255D2961C6237352D93_Alfa_Romeo_Spiders_143640a.jpg","File Size":"7566 bytes","Flags 0":"192","Flags 1":"0","Image Height":"70 pixels","Image Width":"165 pixels","Number of Components":"3","Quality":"60","Resolution Units":"none","Thumbnail Height Pixels":"0","Thumbnail Width Pixels":"0","X Resolution":"100 dots","X-Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.jpeg.JpegParser"],"Y Resolution":"100 dots","resourceName":"D83E8C949F56D255D2961C6237352D93_Alfa_Romeo_Spiders_143640a.jpg","tiff:BitsPerSample":"8","tiff:ImageLength":"70","tiff:ImageWidth":"165"}
