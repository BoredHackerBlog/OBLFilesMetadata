{"Color Transform":"YCbCr","Comment":"Palestinian supporters of Hamas carry the party\u0027s flags as they shout slogans against Pope Benedict XVI during a demonstration in Gaza City 15 September 2006. A wave of Muslim outrage swept the globe today after the Pope linked Islam with violence during a visit to his native Germany. The 79-year-old pontiff implicitly denounced connections between Islam and violence, particularly with regard to jihad, or \"holy war\". His official spokesman said later that Benedict respected Islam but rejected violence motivated by religion. \rAFP PHOTO/MOHAMMED ABED","Component 1":"Y component: Quantization table 0, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 2":"Cb component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Component 3":"Cr component: Quantization table 1, Sampling factors 1 horiz/1 vert","Compression Type":"Baseline","Content-Length":"25900","Content-Type":"image/jpeg","DCT Encode Version":"25600","Data Precision":"8 bits","File Modified Date":"Fri Nov 10 23:32:21 -05:00 2017","File Name":"C8DE68CB3950242D34D04BF56F674E10_C6DE3B074EA249F1893F0D1CEEC5C566.jpg","File Size":"25900 bytes","Flags 0":"192","Flags 1":"0","Image Height":"151 pixels","Image Width":"190 pixels","Number of Components":"3","Quality":"80","Resolution Units":"none","Thumbnail Height Pixels":"0","Thumbnail Width Pixels":"0","X Resolution":"100 dots","X-Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.jpeg.JpegParser"],"Y Resolution":"100 dots","resourceName":"C8DE68CB3950242D34D04BF56F674E10_C6DE3B074EA249F1893F0D1CEEC5C566.jpg","tiff:BitsPerSample":"8","tiff:ImageLength":"151","tiff:ImageWidth":"190"}
