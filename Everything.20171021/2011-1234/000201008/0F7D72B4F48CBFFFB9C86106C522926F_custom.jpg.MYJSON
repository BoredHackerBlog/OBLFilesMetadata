Bush arrived today in Jordan for crucial talks with Baghdad\u0027s Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on quelling an upsurge of sectarian violence in neighbouring Iraq. Bush, accompanied by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, waved as he stepped out of Air Force One before entering his limousine to head for the royal palace for talks with King Abdullah II, who is hosting the summit. He will hold brief three-way talks with the Jordanian monarch and Maliki before meeting the beleaguered Iraqi premier separately over breakfast tomorrow.
