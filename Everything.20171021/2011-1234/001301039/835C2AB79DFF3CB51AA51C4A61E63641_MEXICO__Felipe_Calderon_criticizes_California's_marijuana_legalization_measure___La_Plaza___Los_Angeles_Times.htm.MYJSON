California\u0027s Proposition 19 could have enormous implications for Mexico, and has triggered sharp debates between advocates who say passage could help stop the drug war and critics who are worried that growing demand would empower organized crime groups. Calderon said loosening drug consumption laws would result in \"serious consequences for American and Mexican society.\" \"Drugs kill in production. Drugs kill in distribution, as is the case in the violence in Mexico, and drugs kill in consumption,\" Calderon said. -- Richard Marosi in Tijuana","msvalidate.01":"AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786","resourceName":"835C2AB79DFF3CB51AA51C4A61E63641_MEXICO__Felipe_Calderon_criticizes_California\u0027s_marijuana_legalization_measure___La_Plaza___Los_Angeles_Times.htm","title":"MEXICO: Felipe Calderon criticizes California\u0027s marijuana legalization measure | La Plaza | Los Angeles Times","y_key":"6427f578aa9f5a5d"}
