{"Comment":"The bodies of three of the children of Hamas leader of Nizar Rayan lie in a mortuary in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on January 2, 2009, after they were killed in an Israeli air strike that also killed their father. Israeli warplanes pounded militant targets including a mosque in Gaza today as Hamas ordered a \"day of wrath\" against Israel over the killing of senior commander Rayan. Rayan, a hardliner within the Islamist group, was killed along with several of his wives and children when a missile crashed into a five-storey house in Jabalia in the north of the territory, the medics said.
