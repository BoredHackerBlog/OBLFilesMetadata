Medical technician Michelle Harper testified during the Article 32 hearing that she was working at the Army post\u0027s processing center when gunfire erupted there Nov. 5. She said she hid under a desk and could only see the shooter\u0027s slow, deliberate footsteps around the center as the tragedy unfolded. Harper was the second witness to testify at the hearing to determine if Maj. Nidal Hasan should stand trial.","fb_title":"Military Court Hears Ft.
