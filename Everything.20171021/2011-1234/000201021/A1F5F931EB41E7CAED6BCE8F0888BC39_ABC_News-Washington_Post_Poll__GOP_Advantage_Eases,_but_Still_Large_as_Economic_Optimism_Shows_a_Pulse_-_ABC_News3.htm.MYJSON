A month before Election Day, 31 percent of Americans say the economy\u0027s improving -- far from a majority, but 7 points more than a month ago and among the most since the financial crisis of fall 2008. Dissatisfaction with the federal government, closely related to economic discontent, also has eased by 7 points, albeit to a still-high 71 percent.","fb_title":"Poll: GOP Advantage Eases, but Still Large","keywords":"abc news poll, poll, polling unit, generic ballot, congressional election, midterm elections, midterms, Democrat, Democrats, Republican, Republicans, domestic politics, tea party, deficit, economy, obama, approval, online news, breaking news, headline news, news articles, local news, us news, world news, online news, abc news, abcnews, abc news online","og:image":"http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/nm_capitol_101005_me.jpg","resourceName":"A1F5F931EB41E7CAED6BCE8F0888BC39_ABC_News-Washington_Post_Poll__GOP_Advantage_Eases,_but_Still_Large_as_Economic_Optimism_Shows_a_Pulse_-_ABC_News3.htm","robots":["noarchive","index, follow"],"title":"ABC News-Washington Post Poll: GOP Advantage Eases, but Still Large as Economic Optimism Shows a Pulse - ABC News"}
