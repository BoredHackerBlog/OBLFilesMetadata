{"Color Transform":"YCbCr","Comment":"Islamabad, PAKISTAN: Pakistani policemen frisk a pair of radical Islamic students outside The Red Mosque in Islamabad, 05 July 2007, after their surrender to authorities. Pakistani forces set off \"warning\" blasts and smashed down the door of a besieged pro-Taliban mosque prompting militant students to hurl grenades as pressure mounted on them to surrender. The pre-dawn flare-up, which caused no casualties, came hours after the government scored a major coup by arresting the leader of Islamabad\u0027s Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, as he tried to flee disguised in a burqa. Troops and police backed by armoured personnel carriers and helicopters have surrounded the mosque since Tuesday, when clashes started between students and security forces, killing at least 16 people.
